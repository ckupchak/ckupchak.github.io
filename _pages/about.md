I am an Ambizione Fellow in the Chair of Innovation and IP Policy at EPFL.

I use the tools of data science and machine learning to tackle problems in the Economics of Innovation and Science of Science. Beyond labels, my goal is a systematic understanding academic research careers and global system in which they are embedded.

My career has taken me through many disciplines and fields (Physics, Complex Systems, Bioinformatics and Economics) and across many locations (Manitoba, Boston University, University of Calgary, IMT Lucca and now EPFL). Along the way I have many great mentors and collaborators from whom I have learned a great deal about science, and life.

In addition to my research, I teach, mostly courses on analytics and data science aimed at students studying business or a social science. I have also been known to consult on the side, particularily in the banking industry.
