I am an Ambizione Fellow in the Chair of Innovation and IP Policy at EPFL.

I use the tools of Data Science to tackle problems in the Economics of Innovation, Sociology of Science, and this quick growing area called the Science of Science. But beyond whatever labels it may be necessary to put on it, I am really just trying to systematically understand academic research careers and system in which they are embedded.

I've been lucky to work across a variety of disciplines and areas, including Physics, Complex Systems, Bioinformatics and Economics, and with many great people, from Boston University to the University of Calgary to IMT Lucca and now, EPFL.
