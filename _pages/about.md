I am an Ambizione Fellow in the Chair of Innovation and IP Policy at EPFL.

I use the tools of data science and machine learning to tackle problems in the Economics of Innovation and Science of Science. Beyond labels, my goal is just a systematic understanding academic research careers and system in which they are embedded.

I have worked across a variety of disciplines and areas, including Physics, Complex Systems, Bioinformatics and Economics. And with many great people, from Boston University, to the University of Calgary, to IMT Lucca and EPFL.

In addition to my research, I teach, mostly courses on business analytics or data science for business and social science students. I also have been known to consult on the side, particularily in the banking industry.
